# Game Development (Intermediate)

## Technologies  
These intermediate-level projects focus on more advanced game mechanics, including **game physics**, **AI**, and **multiplayer functionality**. They involve more complex logic, better graphics, and more interactive gameplay.

---

### Stacks Cut  
**Description:** Create a puzzle or card game where players need to cut or rearrange stacks of objects (e.g., cards, blocks). Implement drag-and-drop functionality, stack manipulation, and rules for winning. This could involve simple algorithms to manage the stacks and ensure the correct arrangement of items.

### 2D Platformer  
**Description:** Build a 2D platformer game where the player can jump, run, and avoid obstacles. Implement scrolling backgrounds, collectable items, and a level progression system.

---

### Breakout Clone  
**Description:** Create a Breakout-style game where a paddle bounces a ball to break bricks. Implement multiple levels, power-ups, and score tracking.

---

### Pong (Multiplayer)  
**Description:** Build a multiplayer version of Pong where two players can compete against each other in real-time. Use a simple server-client model or WebSockets for communication.

---

### Space Shooter  
**Description:** Develop a space-themed shooter game where the player controls a spaceship and shoots enemies. Include power-ups, enemies with different behaviors, and a boss fight.

---

### Puzzle Game (e.g., Sudoku, 2048)  
**Description:** Create a logic puzzle game like Sudoku or 2048. Implement an algorithm for puzzle generation, scoring, and a reset function.

---

### Racing Game  
**Description:** Build a racing game where players control a car or bike, avoid obstacles, and compete against the clock or AI. Implement different tracks and speed-ups.

---

### Tower Defense Game  
**Description:** Create a tower defense game where the player places towers to stop waves of enemies from reaching a target. Include different types of towers and enemy units with varying abilities.

---

### Virtual Pet Game  
**Description:** Develop a virtual pet game where the user can feed, play with, and care for a pet. Include basic animations and a state system for the pet’s mood and health.

---

### Chess Game (AI)  
**Description:** Build a chess game where the player can compete against an AI opponent. Implement basic chess rules (e.g., move validation, check, and checkmate). Optionally, create an AI opponent with simple decision-making based on a basic algorithm like Minimax.

---

### Multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe  
**Description:** Build a multiplayer version of Tic-Tac-Toe that allows two players to play over the internet using WebSockets or an API. Implement chat functionality during the game.

---

### Angry Birds Copy (Physics-based)  
**Description:** Create a clone of the popular Angry Birds game, where players launch birds at structures to destroy them and hit targets. Implement a physics-based environment using a physics engine like Box2D or Unity’s built-in physics. The game should include multiple levels with different types of birds (each with unique abilities) and destructible environments that respond to forces. Focus on implementing realistic physics for the projectile motion, collision detection, and destruction mechanics. Optionally, add a scoring system and power-ups.
